### Game Developer looking for experience with teams

My name's Raymond. I like making games and programming; I've been learning how for the past few years, a somewhat bumpy road that has smoothed out a lot recently. If you're a game designer or artist looking to form a team with an equitable revenue sharing model or hire a programmer for your existing team, please feel free to send me an e-mail.

I'm proficient in C#/.NET, MonoGame, and the Godot 4 game engine. I'm currently focusing on improving my C#/.NET skills and learning the Unity game engine (especially DOTS and other forward-facing technology). I've also dabbled in C, C++, SDL2, Unreal Engine 5, and Game Maker Studio. I'm a fast learner and very motivated.

### Words I try to live by

- Less is more.
- There's no replacement for a good night's sleep.
- Commit early, commit often.
- Fail faster.
- Managing complexity is software's primary imperative.
- Simplicity favors regularity.
